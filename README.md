## Edtech website for Coderszonee

CodersZonee is an edtech platform designed to facilitate learning and course management. Built using React and TailwindCSS for the frontend, and Node.js with Express for the backend (still in progress), the platform features multiple pages including Home, About, Contact, and Courses, with a Resources page under development. 

It includes forms for user interaction and an admin panel to manage student and teacher data, with future capabilities to add and delete courses. The project integrates React Router for seamless navigation, react-multi-carousel for creating carousels, uses FontAwesome for icons and other libraries.
